/*
Package fs contains abstractions not provided by io/fs needed to provide services such
as writing files and utility functions that can be useful.

OpenFiler provides OpenFile() similar to the "os" package when you need to write file data.

Writer provides a WriteFile() similar to the "os" package when you want to write an entire file
at once.

OFOption provides a generic Option type for implementations of OpenFile() to use.

This package also introduces a Merge() function to allow merging of filesystem content into
another filesystem and the ability to tranform the content in some way (like optimizations).

Using Merge to optimize embed.FS Javascript into a subdirectory "js":

	optimized := simple.New(simple.WithPearson())

	err := Merge(
		optimized,
		somePkg.Embeded,
		"/js/",
		WithTransform(
			func(name string, content []byte) ([]byte, error){
				// If we are in debug mode, we want unoptimized Javascript
				if debug {
					return content, nil
				}
				switch path.Ext(name){
				case "js":
					return optimizeJS(content)
				case "go":
					return nil, nil
				}
				return content, nil
			},
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		// Do something
	}
	optimized.RO()

The above code takes embedded Javscript stored in an embed.FS and if we are not in a debug mode,
optimized the Javscript with an optimizer. This allows us to keep our embed.FS local to the code
that directly uses it and create an overall filesystem for use by all our code while also
optmizing that code for production.
